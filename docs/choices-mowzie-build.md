# Mowzie build: choices

Choices made while building MOWZIE.md §9's slices, where the plan left something open. Ids are
MZB-#, and each slice takes ids from its own range so slices built side by side never collide:
M1 1 to 49, M2 50 to 99, M3 100 to 149, M4 150 to 199, M5 200 to 249, M6 250 to 299, M7 300 to 349,
M8 350 to 399, M9 400 to 449, M10 450 to 499, M11 500 to 549, M12 550 to 599. Each slice writes only
under its own heading.

## M2 Cultures

- **MZB-50** (empty rungs, both ways): `Culture::has_rung`, `next_up` and `next_down` (ledger 2).
  A climb goes to the next rung up that has a party, or to Notice, at the threshold of the rung it
  goes to and after the dwell of the rung it leaves. Every step down (the calm in `feud_wake`, each
  of a fallen chief's two steps, an unmet demand's fall) goes on down past empty rungs, floored at
  Notice, so from Siege with Invasion and Raid empty a chief's fall lands on Envoy and a calm on
  Scouts. An unmet demand climbs to `next_up(Envoy)` (Scouts for every culture so far).
  `send_party` sends nothing for an empty make-up. `Culture::resolve` lets any party be empty and
  wants a plunder party only from a culture with `plunder_mean_days`. Reason: the lead's rule, and
  one helper pair keeps every site the same.
- **MZB-51** (a repeat counts from the turn home): `repeat_days` (ledger 3). A feud on Raid or
  Invasion with no party out and no demand books one event at the latest of the rung's threshold
  crossing, `since + repeat_days`, its cowed time and its pool wait; the earliest of climb, repeat
  and fall is booked, and at the wake the climb is tried first, so a tie climbs. The repeat sends
  the same rung's party through `escalate(.., again)`: the raid grudge and `raids` as a climb, but
  counted in `stats.repeats` (saved last in the stats), noted "repeat", and with no CONFLICT_STEP
  (its CONFLICT_PARTY records it). No new Feud field: `since` is set when a band turns for home
  (`go_home`), so the 4 days include the walk back, under half a day in a den's 200-block range.
  Fork: the plan says "after it is home"; counting from the arrival exactly needs a Feud field,
  which a later slice can add if the walk matters. Without `repeat_days` nothing is booked and the
  wake is today's.
- **MZB-52** (a pool wait for whole warriors): `escalate`'s wait is `ceil(want / 2)`, the whole
  warriors `send_party` needs. Without it a party of odd size (the Frostmaw's 1, the raiders'
  Invasion of 23) waited for half a warrior, failed to muster and woke its feud again at once. M2
  takes this one line; M4 builds the rest of ledger 6.
- **MZB-53** (threat source and class from the culture): `source` (`bandit` by default, `boss`)
  is what ambushes and district raids tell the industry engine (ledger 9). District raids already
  send one threat per class. An ambush sends one: its class is the party's strongest by strength,
  ties to the first in `ThreatClass` order, which is ground melee for every war party of goblins,
  bandits and raiders, so their ambushes are unchanged.
- **MZB-54** (the crystal row): `UnitDef.without_crystal` names the row a unit fights as while its
  chief lacks its crystal, and `Faction.crystal` (true until a report says otherwise, saved) picks
  it for strength, class, carry and losses. A body is always the unit's own row's, so the plugin
  sees one Frostmaw body either way. Nothing clears the bit yet: CHIEF_STATE is M6's.
- **MZB-55** (eaten loot leaves the books): `loot_destroyed` (ledger 10). A village's stock is taken
  by `World::take_stock`, booked as destroyed in the market's line as a dragon's prey is, and
  counted in `ConflictLedger::destroyed`; goods taken from players (district raids, ambushes,
  watched looting) are counted in `destroyed_from_players` and never carried. `check` balances
  taken against landed, held or carried, and destroyed. Both maps are saved with the ledger.
- **MZB-56** (a lair must destroy its loot): `resolve` refuses `haven: false` without
  `loot_destroyed`. Reason: a lair has no storehouse, so carried loot could never land.
- **MZB-57** (tribute by value): the demand is
  `ceil(tribute_per_grievance × grievance × bend / 1000 × per_coin)` (ledger 12). `per_coin` is 1
  for money (a currency good, as gifts count it), else one coin's worth at the haven market's price,
  else `tribute_per_coin_fallback` (1 when absent; the Umvuthana's 9) while that market has no
  price. The emerald cultures' demands are unchanged.
- **MZB-58** (the `gold_nugget` good): added to the synthetic catalogue last (GoodId 9, so no other
  id moves), with no recipe and no need, and mapped to `minecraft:gold_nugget` in the phase 1
  catalogue. No market prices it yet, so the fallback carries every Umvuthana demand.
- **MZB-59** (the lair): `NodeKind::Lair`, a unit variant saved as tag 3, with no culture and no
  storehouse. `World::join` gives it a base market as it does a player base, so the ~6.6 KB a
  market-less node would save was not taken: every market read would have to handle a node with
  none. A raid on a lair meets haven defence (`haven_defence_per_pop`), plunder never picks one,
  ribbit bands never visit, its holder kind is a haven's, and the layers draw it as category 4.
- **MZB-60** (`frostmaw.json`): goblin's thresholds, dwell, hysteresis, half-life, demand and relief
  values, march, muster, patience, linger, siege interval and cowed time; `human` market only to
  resolve, with `haven: false`; `chief_lifespan_days` 1,000,000; territory 200 and reach 0. Killing
  8.0 and building 0.05 from goblin, logging and mining 0, no smog or radiation (Rail is M7).
  Units `frostmaw` (ground ranged) and `frostmaw_bare` (ground melee), both strength 41.7, carry 64,
  breaks 0, body `mic_rtsim:conflict/frostmaw/frostmaw`. Raid and Invasion are one `frostmaw`;
  Envoy, Scouts, Siege and plunder are empty; it hates nobody and never plunders. `repeat_days` 4,
  source `boss`, `loot_destroyed`. Fork: `pool_cap` 1 with `recruits_per_day` 1/6, a PLACEHOLDER
  for the den's 6-day first wait until M4 and M6 book arrivals; until then the pool regrows by
  itself.
- **MZB-61** (`umvuthana.json`): goblin's values as above, territory 200 and reach 0, lifespan
  1,000,000; goblin's smog, logging, mining, killing and building weights, no radiation. Units
  `warrior`, `raptor` (a pack, 2.6) and `envoy`, all ground melee with carry and breaks 0, bodies
  `mic_rtsim:conflict/umvuthana/<unit>`. Parties as MOWZIE.md §4.5, siege empty. `pool_cap` 9, the
  top of a grove's 5 to 9 until ledger 7 counts each grove; recruits 2 a day. Hates `human`;
  plunders every 12 days within 1,500 blocks with one raptor pack, whose take is eaten
  (`loot_destroyed`, MZ-8) and is nothing until raptors carry. Tribute in `gold_nugget` at a
  fallback of 9 an emerald; no repeat; source `bandit`.
- **MZB-62** (the `sim mowzie` scaffold): `rtsim-cli sim mowzie [list | run N ...]`, runs numbered
  as MOWZIE.md §7. M2 builds run 1's den ladder, with kills in the range standing in for the rail
  meter, and run 5's grove ladder with its priced demand; every other run, and the rest of these
  two, prints the slice that builds it. JSON goes to `scenario/results/sim-mowzie.json`.
